• What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
--> It helps in ignorring the unnecceary files like node modules, some of text amd media files created to check 
on local environment. For any java project gitignore should include ".class" files. .

• What does fast-forward in git mean?
--> If Master has not diverged, instead of creating a new commit, git will just point master to the latest 
commit of the feature branch. This is a “fast forward.” SO simply there won't be any "merge commit" in fast-forwarding merge.

• Why should you have different branches?
--> Whenever multiple people are working on a same project it is a good practice that each developer works on seperate 
branch and each commit is made on the basis of task assigned and then regularly updates their branch 
with the developer branch. Ideally a developer branch should be made where each developer pull requests 
their changes and as a stable tested version gets ready it should be merged with master.

• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
--> A git project can have as many as remote git repositories just one condition that the names are different.
